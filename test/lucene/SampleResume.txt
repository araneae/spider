Arjun Srivastava11022 Rivera CV San Ramon, CA  78249 arjun@gmail.com, 001-212-323-6395INTRODUCTIONOver my 18+ year career, I have been extremely fortunate to be part of a broad range of projects encompassing numerous disciplines. This has afforded me a very global view of enterprise architecture. The accumulation of these skills has allowed me to be effective within the unique business paradigms of different corporations.Over the last eight years, I have provided enterprise and IT architectural services to corporations including transportation-commerce and financial services. During my engagements, I developed strategic and technology roadmaps specific to corporate goals, vision and business priorities. The success of all my architectures were directly attributed to the development of these long-term strategies and helping business units articulate their true business priorities within them. Much of my architecture work has been accomplished by using open standards. In addition to the traditional technology architectures, I have also developed service-oriented architectures (SOA) providing common process and data exchange. I am well versed with traditional broker technologies as well as true SOA services. In the development of enterprise architectures, I work closely with business and solution analysts to develop process models for various aspects of these architectures detailing workflows and processes for security, audit points, governance and best practices among others.All my architectural projects leveraged both existing and innovative technologies. My responsibilities within these projects included defining and leading the resources for research, evaluation, technical feasibility and proof-of-concept development of asset and new technologies to fit developed architectures. The enterprise positions I have executed requires me to have exceptional business relationship skills providing myself as both the technical and business liaison for architecture projects ensuring all business units are in agreement and onboard with corporate objectives. SKILLS SUMMARY •	Demonstrated experience in enterprise architecture and IT architecture.•	Demonstrated experience in customer service and vendor management.•	Excellent in Program Management and Process Engineering.•	Strong experience with Java application servers.•	Extensive experience web servers.•	Extensive experience in JAVA EE applications•	Extensive experience with multiple infrastructure platforms.•	Demonstrated experience in Relational Databases.•	Demonstrated experience in Application and data architecture.•	Experience in performance management and capacity planning.•	Experience with DNS, load balancing devices and other network appliances.•	Experienced in Quality Assurance.•	Experienced in Emerging Technologies.•	Experience with server, storage, network and application Virtualization technologies•	Experience with security and Identity Management solutions.•	Experience with message oriented middleware.•	Experience in using open source technologies.•	Experience in managing offshore development teams.•	Knowledge of BPM and BAM platforms.•	Knowledge of ITIL, Waterfalls, RUP and MDA.•	Strong aptitude for learning new technologies and business domains.•	Interacting with developers, project managers and focus groups to minimize expenditure, avoid redundancy, and improve overall synergy within organization.Professional ExperienceHarland Clarke Holding Corporation, San Antonio TX       September 2011 to Present  Enterprise IT Architect: Harland Clarke is a multimillion e-commerce and financial services company specialized in web to print and social stationary vertical .As a seasoned professional, I provide extensive leadership and mentorship of architectural practices and capabilities.
